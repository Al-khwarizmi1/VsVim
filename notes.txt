Working on :help o_v

When v exclusive to inclusive hits an end of line it returns an empty Motion, not a failed on. This can be observed 
when you combine with yank. It clears the unnamed register. 

Need to convert all of the linewise motions to provide a characterwise span as well. 

Need to test direction as well.
