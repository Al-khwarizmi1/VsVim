Working on :help o_v

When v exclusive to inclusive hits an end of line it returns an empty Motion, not a failed on. This can be observed 
when you combine with yank. It clears the unnamed register. 

The char -> line wise motion is tricky. It doesn't use the actual linewise span. Instead it's the logical motion 
span that got extended to line wise. Consider `j` which moves down. The logical span is current caret to the 
column just below. Need to implement this for all line wise in order to get this done. Probably need 
MotionResult.CreateLineWise API
